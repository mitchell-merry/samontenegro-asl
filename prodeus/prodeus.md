# Prodeus Autosplitter
## Description
ASL file for [Prodeus](https://www.prodeusgame.com/). Does not time during loads (load remover), splits automatically upon reaching the results screen of each level and may be configured to also split when transitioning from the Intro level to Sacrum. Do note this ASL *continues to time in the overworld, during pause, and while the weapon wheel HUD is open*, but may be easily modified to not do so.

## Requirements
