# Signalis Autosplitter
## Description
ASL file for [Signalis](http://rose-engine.org/signalis//). Does not time during loads, cutscenes or door traversals (load remover), and splits automatically upon changing levels. Do note this ASL script **continues to time in the main menu, while the inventory is open, and while dialog is running**, but may be easily modified to not do so.

## Requirements
